        <p id="london">Something excited happened when we arrived to London. We just got off the plane when a weird lady started to talk to us. We were afraid, because we did not know her initials intentions. She began to talk about how her daugther was supposed to attend a Harry Styles' concert but she got COVID-19 and was ill. So she was looking for a group of teens who would like to take their place. WE WERE SHOCKED!!!!!!! We accepted the tickets and give the woman a hug. We were extremely grateful for her kidness. It was the best concert ever. :) </p>

        <p id="londoneye"> It was our fifth month in London and we wanted to have a deserved night out. We went to Ristorante Frescobaldi and then to a famous pub next to the London Eye. When we were on our way home, we decided to ride on it. When we were on the top it broke. WE WERE TRAPPED. LLovelini was that scared that she peeded hershelf. It took 3 hours to get us off and a pair of wet trousers.  </p>

    <p id="Basque"> It was the birthday of our beloved friend Jon. We wanted to surprise him by coming back home to the Basque Country. He was really excited to see us again and started talking english with us because he really wants to become a younger english teacher. He has really good marks in this subject and want to obtain the B1 certificate. We are sure he will be able to get it pretty soon. Good luck Jon! ;) </p>
